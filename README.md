Numerotation Block System for Cryptocurrency
    Welcome to the CDI (CryptoCurrency Digital Identity) Numerotation Block System repository, a groundbreaking initiative designed to enhance the transparency, traceability, and artistic potential of cryptocurrency ecosystems.

Project Overview
    The CDI system assigns unique identifiers to each unit of cryptocurrency, acting as a digital fingerprint that tracks the lifecycle and ownership of every coin. 
    
  By operating in a parallel block to existing blockchain networks, CDI ensures enhanced safety and privacy     for users while maintaining public access to essential data.

Key Features
    Unique Identifiers: Each cryptocurrency unit receives a CDI, enabling precise tracking of its history, including transactions, conversions, and age.
    Parallel Operation: The CDI block runs alongside cryptocurrency blocks, reinforcing security and privacy across networks.

 Data and Currency Analysis: 
 CDIs unlock valuable insights into currency growth and spread, allowing analysts to trace the journey of individual coins and understand market dynamics.
    
  Creative Visualization: 
  Harnessing the power of AI, CDIs can be transformed into artistic representations, such as digital trees and forests that narrate the real stories of coins. These visualizations can enrich the world of NFTs with unique narratives and data-        driven art.

  Applications Enhanced Transparency:
  By providing a clear record of each coin's history, the system fosters accountability and trust within the cryptocurrency community.
  
  Artistic Innovation: 
  The ability to visualize and tell the stories of coins can revolutionize how digital assets are perceived, offering new opportunities in the NFT space.
  
   Collaborative Development: 
   We invite contributions and partnerships to expand this system, making it accessible and beneficial for all.

Below is a Python script demonstrating how to generate CDIs for various cryptocurrencies:


    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    import random

    def generate_DCI(currency_symbol, network, status):
    # Randomize creation time within a specific range
    creation_time = datetime(2024, 12, 12) + timedelta(seconds=random.randint(0, 86400))
    
    # Randomize unit number
    unit_number = random.randint(1, 999)
    
    # Format time and date
    time_str = creation_time.strftime("%H%M%S")
    date_str = creation_time.strftime("%d%m%y")
    
    # Format unit number to be three digits
    unit_number_str = f"{unit_number:03d}"
    
    # Construct the CDI
    CDI = f"{currency_symbol}x{network}{time_str}{date_str}{unit_number_str}{status}"
    return CDI

    # List of currencies with their symbols and networks
    currencies = [
    {"symbol": "btc", "network": "bit", "address": "1ASCSMECbxhznAo1ZHfJNnu4PnypXE2aBq"},
    {"symbol": "eth", "network": "erc", "address": "0x8099a06ec7b535bc52e8c5f5e61c8646b82d92ac"},
    {"symbol": "bnb", "network": "bep", "address": "0x8099a06ec7b535bc52e8c5f5e61c8646b82d92ac"},
    {"symbol": "ton", "network": "ton", "address": "UQA6iJoqAaNLML_FneH9EwY8bnzPnYAvO_AjIFc1UNSTppjI"},
    {"symbol": "usdt", "network": "trc", "address": "TYsNNi5VwmSeBDXZn272iUJ9dVtivVLmmZ"}
    ]

    # Generate and print a random CDI for each currency
    for currency in currencies:
    status = random.choice(['a', 'b', 'f'])  # 'a' for active, 'b' for burned, 'f' for frozen
    CDI = generate_CDI(currency["symbol"], currency["network"], status)
    print(f"Generated CDI for {currency['symbol'].upper()} (Address: {currency['address']}): {CDI}")
