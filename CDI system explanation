System Overview
Independent Blockchains
The system supports multiple independent blockchains, such as Bitcoin (BTC), TON, and Ethereum (ETH). Each blockchain operates independently and is responsible for creating unique coin data identifiers (CDIs).

Parallel Blockchain (CDI Creator)
The parallel blockchain is responsible for generating CDIs for coins from each independent blockchain. These CDIs are then managed by the central node.

Central Node (Circulation Manager)
The central node acts as a circulation hub, managing and tracking the flow of CDIs between wallets. It maintains a detailed log of each CDI's movement, including the date and time of each transfer.

Circulation Model
The circulation model depicts a network of wallets, illustrating the flow and circulation of CDIs between them, managed by the central node.

Conclusion
This system provides a robust framework for managing coin data identifiers across multiple blockchains, leveraging a central node to ensure seamless circulation and tracking of CDIs. This architecture enhances transparency and traceability within the blockchain ecosystem.
